# ImgReconPjts
Projects on this folder are related to image recognition using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. They were developed in 2020 as part of the training for Mechatronics classes at [ENSAM](https://artsetmetiers.fr/fr/mecatronique)

Folders:

1) Detection mouvement: Project in which we use [YOLO](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/machine-learning/yolo-algorithm-real-time-object-detection-from-a-to-z) You Only Look Once to identify objects in images.

2) Synthetic_data_generation: Here we used software [YOLO](https://www.blender.org/) to create 3D replicas of objects we want to identify. Then, we use YOLO to identify objects in images.

3) Visages: In this project, we use [Haar](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) cascades to identify faces (but it can be generalized to identify other kinds of objects.
